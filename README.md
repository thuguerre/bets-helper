# Bets Helper

Personal project to help me retrieving useful* results for my bets on Winamax.

## Getting Started

Please refer to [Getting Started procedure](./getting-started/README.md).

## Actions operated

* Using a GitHub Scheduled Workflow, Japan Baseball's NPB Regular Season results are retrieved each day and sent to a private SpreadSheet, where they are then humanly analyzed and used to bet.


*For the moment, useful means looseful.
